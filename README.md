# Prisoner's Dilemma

A system for building and running [Prisoner's Dilemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner's_dilemma) strategies.

Currently, strategies must be implemented in code. Ability to build new strategies within the app is planned.

## Future Plans

- Allow creation of strategies within app
- Tournaments
- Birth/death simulation mode, allowing lifecycle analyses
- Better visualisation of results
